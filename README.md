# Time Machine

## Inspiration
Have you ever wanted to have a face to face conversation with your past self? 
Well, the time machine is here for you, letting you talk to your past self!

## What it does
Time Machine takes an image of your younger self, along with your age at the time and the situational description to create a moving AI image that can talk to you!

## How we built it
We built the front end using React, TypeScript, HTML and CSS.
The backend was created using python, cohere API and gooey.AI API.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges we ran into was connecting the front end and the back end, however, we were able to accomplish this by axios. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have used the cohere and gooey.AI APIs for the first time as it helped us understand how to integrate/use APIs on the backend. 

## What we learned
We learned how to connect the front end and the back end. We also learned how to use the cohere command and gooey.ai APIs. 

## What's next for Time Machine
We would like to extend its functionality to have conversations with past relatives such as long gone grandparents, past friend or even a past famous figure. We would also incorporate an image enhancer and sentiment analysis on the data inputted by the user. Furthermore, for our specific version, we would like to train an ML model on the user's past text messages with other people to gauge a better understanding of the user's specific life story, enhancing the conversations. In addition, we will add a voice input option to give users the option to mimic voices through the AI.
